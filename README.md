# Infra test

### Instructions

Create a script which will follow below steps:

1. Clone this repository (master)
2. Use any mechanism (web server, containers) you prefer to deploy [amdocs.html](amdocs.html)
3. Configure any port different from 80 and 443, like 8080, for example.
4. It should run multiple times, so include conditionals to check existing items
5. Finally, include simple loop to validate deployment is reachable.

Good luck!
